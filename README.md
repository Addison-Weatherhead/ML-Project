# ML-Project
Using the NNFS book by Sentdex, I've implemented a neural network using just numpy. No Tensorflow, no Keras, just Numpy.


Also a huge shoutout to Harrison Kinsley and Daniel Kukiela (the authors of the book) who created an incredibly detailed document! To be clear, this project is based off of their code in the book, so if there is copyrights to be given, it should be given to them. Check out the book here: https://nnfs.io
