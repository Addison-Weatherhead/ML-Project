# ML-Project
Using the NNFS book by Sentdex, I've implemented a neural network using just numpy. No Tensorflow, no Keras, just Numpy.

Also here's a (poorly made) video I made that goes through my implementation of backprop. I found the NNFS did not explain backprop very well, so this is my best explanation of it.
